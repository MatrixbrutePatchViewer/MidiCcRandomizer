# MidiCcRandomizer
A generic MIDI CC randomizer that can be customized to be used with any synth/equipment accepting MIDI CC, including VSTs.

Download the PDF manual (or read it online) for more information. Download the zip for installing the application.

The current version will always be MidiCcRandomizer.zip and MidiCcRandomizer_manual.pdf

Requires java 11+. Created and tested on windows. Will probably also work on mac (with more or less adjustments)

The source might be released sometime later.
