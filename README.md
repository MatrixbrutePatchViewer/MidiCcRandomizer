# MidiCcRandomizer
A generic MIDI CC randomizer that can be customized to be used with any synth/equipment accepting MIDI CC, including VSTs. 
It can also be used to modify any CC-paramter in realtime by click+dragging over a CC-value field with the mouse.

New synths can be added by creating new definition files from scratch, or by downloading and importing already existing csv-file from this project: https://github.com/pencilresearch/midi 

Download the PDF manual (or read it online) for more information on installation and how to use it. Download the zip for installing the application.
The current version will always be **MidiCcRandomizer.zip** and **MidiCcRandomizer_manual.pdf**

Requires java 11+. Created and tested on windows. Will probably also work on mac (with more or less adjustments)

The source might be released sometime later.
